## Mermaid in Markdown

`render-md-mermaid` will pick up any Mermaid graph in Markdown files that is defined as:

~~~markdown
![rendered image description](relative/path/to/demo_image. svg or png )
<details>
  <summary>diagram source</summary>
  This details block is collapsed by default when viewed in GitHub. This hides the mermaid graph definition, while the rendered image
  linked above is shown. The details tag has to follow the image tag. (newlines allowed)

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
  
</details>
~~~

The script will pick up the graph definition from the mermaid code block and render it to the image file and path specified in the
image tag using [mermaid-cli](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli). The rendered image can be in svg or png format, whatever is specified will be generated. The result is displayed like this:

![rendered image description](relative/path/to/demo_image.png)
<details>
  <summary>diagram source</summary>
  This details block is collapsed by default when viewed in GitHub.
  This hides the mermaid graph definition, while the rendered image
  linked above is shown.
  The details tag has to follow the image tag. (newlines allowed)

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

</details>

When using the GitHub Action, this will automatically happen for every Markdown file in the repository.
